I am using visual studio 17.3.3
This program assume all videos are 640*480
To run this program it takes in 3 arguments for example:
background_subtraction_2 background_moving_2 0
which correspond to
foreground background mode
mode = 1 for green screen
mode = 0 for background subtraction

My code takes around 3 minutes to preprocess on my device
